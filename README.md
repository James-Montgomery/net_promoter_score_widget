# NPS Tool

I have a mild fascination with coding languages. I like playing around and writing the same code in multiple languages. A long time ago I wrote a tool to run a beta-binomial model using javascript. Why would I do that? 1) it was fun 2) I was learning JS and 3) its the beginnings of an electron app for bayesian testing that never got finished.

Anyway, this is an example of using the beta-binomial model to analyze net promoter scores. I'm putting this widgit on github for anyone else that wants to play with the code. Hopefully at some point I can pick the project back up and finish the bayesian testing electron app!

**Caution:** This is a toy widgit that is not yet complete. Code used in production should have tests, user guides, etc. Have fun!
